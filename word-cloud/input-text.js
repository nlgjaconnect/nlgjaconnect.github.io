LGBTQ youth are a vulnerable population, and that discrimination plays out in a number of ways. One of the most commonly-cited statistics is that they comprise 40 percent of the homeless youth population, often as the result of family rejection — and according to new research from Loyola University and the University of Pennsylvania, this puts them at risk for equally pressing problem: human trafficking. After interviewing hundreds of homeless youth across the U.S. and Canada, researchers found that LGBTQ youth are disproportionately affected by sex trafficking, particularly if they're transgender. Despite certain legislative victories for LGBTQ rights over the past few years, the system of discrimination is still in place, leaving the community at risk for exploitation in ways that heterosexual individuals may not realize.
Aiming to get an idea of how many homeless youth had been victims of trafficking, Loyola researchers interviewed more than 900 young adults staying in Covenant House shelters in 12 cities. Disturbingly, nearly one fifth of those interviewed reported being trafficked in some way. The majority had been victims of sex trafficking, but seven percent had been forced into labor, and three percent were trafficked for both.
When the study broke down demographics, researchers found that homeless young women were more likely than men to be trafficked or engage in the sex trade. LGBT youth only comprised 19 percent of respondents, but they accounted for 34 percent of the sex trafficking victims and 32 percent of sex trade workers among those interviewed.

In another study, University of Pennsylvania researchers interviewed around 300 homeless youth, focusing on those who acknowledged they had been trafficked. According to their results, those with a history of childhood maltreatment were more likely to become trafficking victims; in contrast, those who reported the presence of a supportive adult in their lives were less likely. Like the Loyola study, the results indicated that LGBT youth are disproportionately likely to experience human trafficking: 39 percent of the sex trafficking victims identified as LGBTQ.
Among LGBTQ victims, transgender people are the most at-risk. According to Pennsylvania researchers, transgender youth had the highest incidence of sex trafficking, and Loyola researchers found that 56 percent of transgender youth reported being involved in the sex trade in some way.
Without shelter or social support, homelessness leaves anyone at risk for trafficking, but by all accounts, LGBTQ youth are especially affected — not least because they make up such a high proportion of homeless young adults. Furthermore, traffickers prey on their victims' vulnerabilities, and once they've been trafficked, the stigma surrounding their sexuality or gender identity may be one of the factors preventing them from asking for help. "LGBTQ youth may fear the repercussions of reporting their situation, particularly if they worry others will mistreat or not believe them because of their gender identity or sexual orientation," writes the Polaris Project on its website.
Youth homelessness is a complicated problem, made more complicated when LGBTQ discrimination comes into play. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, LGBTQ homeless individuals are at a higher risk for violence, and finding shelters that accept them is easier said than done. Although a growing number of queer-focused shelters are being created lately, it's clear that the problem of LGBTQ youth homelessness, and all the risks that come with it, won't be solved easily.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - It's being labeled an epidemic: alarmingly high suicide rates, homeless rates, and sex trafficking rates among LGBT youth, especially in religious homes.
To try and change the trend, a group named Faith in America walked into the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention on Friday to share a message that LGBT youth are in danger.
"400,000 kids are on the streets because they feel safer there than in their parent's home," Robert Hoffman, interim executive director and co-chair of Faith in America, said.
According to statistics from Faith in America and the The Trevor Project, LGBT youth have been four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual counterparts, and when they're in highly rejecting homes, including religious homes, they can be more than eight times as likely than other LGBT youth to attempt suicide.
LGBT youth also make up more than 40 percent of homeless teens in America, and LGBT children and youth have been 70 times more likely to be victims of sex trafficking.
"We want to get the LGBT off the sin list," Stan Mitchell, senior pastor at GracePointe Church, said. "We believe it is harming human beings."
The group had asked to take part in the conference, specifically in a breakout session regarding how to deal with homosexuality when it comes to religion, but they were turned down. That's when the group decided to make their voices heard, both with prayer and song by singing "Amazing Grace" inside of the Gaylord Opryland Hotel where the conference was taking place.
"We just wanted to remind them, folks like us who affirm the LGBT community follow the same Christ, and we sing out of the same hymnal," Mitchell said.
Friday's group was filled with some who previously saw being gay as a sin, as well as those who struggled with their own journey.
"As my faith and my own sexuality became a question for me, I experienced so much rejection from this community," Brandan Robertson, lead pastor at Mission Gathering Christian Church in San Diego, California, said.
Robertson, an LGBT Christian pastor, has had firsthand experience on how tough gaining acceptance in a religious community can be, but he said he believes it's time to accept the LGBT community and treat them as equals, just as the church has done with other disenfranchised groups in the past.
"I think that being here and having these conversations is so important because if we're not here doing it, then nobody's going to do it," Robertson said.
Faith in America has attended conferences and visited schools across the country to spread their message, and they hope eventually all religions will accept the LGBT community.

Hundreds of cases of human trafficking are reported in Florida every year, and a new report from 2016 shows the number of human trafficking cases in the state doubled in the last year.

The vast majority of trafficked persons in Florida are young women, and sex trafficking is the most common form of human trafficking in the state, according to a report from Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Children and Families.

The reports' authors say Florida's reputation as a tourist destination means traffickers respond to the demand for sex tourism by trafficking victims to the state during tourist season.

The report also sheds light on the issue of LGBT youth trafficked in Florida, finding they make up a disproportionate amount of the state's homeless youth—an already growing group—and are three times more likely to turn to the sex industry to survive.

Monday at 1 p.m. on Gulf Coast Live, Bethany Gilot, the Human Trafficking Director with DJJ, explains what the report tell us about human trafficking in South Florida, and the prevalence of sex tourism in the region.

Also joining the program are Lowell and Sandy Senitz with Wings of Shelter International, operating two “safehouses” in Southwest Florida helping girls saved from sex trafficking.
Studies conducted by a US university show that homeless LGBT youth are at a higher risk for sex trafficking.
Covenant House International, the largest privately funded youth homeless shelter in the Americas, commissioned a study from Loyola University’s Modern Slavery Research Project (MSRP) on Labor and Sex Trafficking Among Homeless Youth.
The research shows that homeless LGBT youth are disproportionately affected by sex trafficking.
The MSRP interviewed 641 young adults aged 17-25 from ten cities across the US and Canada.
Nearly one in five (124) were identified as victims of some form of human trafficking.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), defines sex trafficking as “the recruitment, harbouring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.”
Of the 124 trafficking victims, 74 percent reported being trafficked for sex, 41 percent for labor and 17 percent for both sex and labor.
Of the 92 young people trafficked for sex, over a third identified as LGBT.

Half of the LGBT youth interviewed reported they engaged in the sex trade in some way during their lifetime.
Homeless youth are more vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking because they experience a high rate of trafficking risk factors.

These include: poverty, a history of mental health problems and sexual abuse, unemployment and unstable home lives.
Those interviewed expressed that they struggled to find paid work, housing and support systems once they were on the streets.
Traffickers prey on these factors and manipulate them to turn to the sex trade for survival.
Another Covenant House study commissioned from The University of Pennsylvania’s Field Center for Children’s Policy, Practice and Research interviewed nearly 270 youth in Phoenix, Pensilvania and Washington, DC.
Nearly one fifth of those interviewed were victims of sex trafficking.
39 percent of those trafficked for sex identified as LGBT.
Both studies also show that homeless transgender youth have the highest rates of sex trafficking within any demographic.
The Field Center reported that 60 percent of the youth involved in sex trafficking identified as transgender. 56 percent involved in the MSRP study reported the same.
Both studies mention that the sample for trans youth was too small to make a conclusive statement about this data. Although they did expressed that it could indicate an important and concerning trend.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a homeless transgender woman, Dessai Scott felt she had nowhere to turn when her boyfriend started to sell her for sex, but she hopes going public about her ordeal can help other trafficking victims.
Having transitioned from a boy to a girl when she was 12, Scott was thrown out of her home at age 16 when her mother died, allowing her then boyfriend to exploit her.
Scott, now 22, said it took two years and several escape bids before she finally broke free, supported by U.S. non-profit FAIR Girls that works to prevent exploitation of girls, and she hopes her story will give other victims courage to seek help.
Studies show transgender youth, who are over-represented among the homeless and runaways, are particularly at risk of sex trafficking and less likely to seek help, fearing discrimination.
“I just wish I’d known there was support and help there for me,” said Scott, who will speak on Tuesday at Trust Conference/America Forum, a one-day event run by the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the fight against slavery and human trafficking.
Scott, who grew up in Washington, D.C., is studying to be a nurse.
“I don’t know about elsewhere, but in D.C. transgender people are only seen as good for sex and get no respect,” she said. “I can’t count the amount of times I was sold or to how many men.”
The rights of transgender people - estimated by the UCLA Williams Institute to account for 0.6 percent of the U.S. population or 1.4 million Americans - have burst into U.S. awareness in the past two years.
AT RISK
With this the vulnerability of young transgender people, many of whom are rejected by their families, has become an area of increasing concern.
A study released this month by Covenant House, a shelter for homeless teenagers in the United States and Canada, found nearly a fifth of 911 homeless youngsters had been trafficked.
But the rate of sex trafficking among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) youth was the highest, with 27 percent reporting experiences consistent with the U.S. federal definition compared with the overall 15 percent.
Sex trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for commercial sex which is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or where the person is aged under 18.
“The unique obstacles faced by transgender individuals can make them especially susceptible to exploitation. Traffickers know this,” said Kendall Meyer from anti-slavery group Polaris.
Scott said often victims do not see the risks.
“Traffickers can be anyone. My boyfriend was abusive, but my parents were abusive so I thought it was normal,” she said.
“It was only when I realized one day that I was being drugged and molested when I was asleep that I called for help.”
Now a survivor advocate, Scott mentors young women exiting human trafficking and in 2015 co-wrote a stage production, DC Traffick, based partly on her own life.
She said particular care was needed to help transgender people who, according to the largest U.S. survey of transgender people released last year, suffer higher rates of poverty, substance abuse and mental health issues than others.
"We get beaten. I've been raped constantly," said Scott. "Dealing with the LGBT community you need to be understanding, open minded, and non-judgmental." (Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

LGBT people are disproportionately affected by digital sex trafficking, activists have reported.
A huge 12 percent of cases reported since 2005 about remote interactive sexual acts – via webcam, phone sex lines or text – involved LGBT people.
Victims are classed as those participating because of force, fraud or coercion, or if the victim is under 18.
US anti-slavery charity Polaris has said that other sex trafficking categories used in its National Human Trafficking Hotline records typically show two to five percent of victims are LGBT.
The rate of LGBT victims forced into digital sex trafficking was “surprising,” Polaris’s chief executive Bradley Myles told Thomson Reuters Foundation.

He added that he was “glad this is helping to paint a broader picture, so people don’t gravitate towards the obvious aspects of trafficking and so we can help to unearth the parts that are getting ignored, especially in the LGBTQ community.
“There is a wider lack of understanding how there is an LGBTQ element to the sex trade, whether in person or through remote interactive webcams, or other remote interactive sex acts,” he added.

Myles also emphasised that there was “an added vulnerability there through homelessness,” in reference to the LGBT community.
Studies have indicated that as much as 40 percent of homeless young people are LGBT.
These homeless LGBT youths are more likely to be victims of crime than their straight counterparts, other surveys have found.
Last year, 7,572 trafficking cases were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, a rise of 24 percent on 2015.
73 percent of these reports – 5,550 cases – related to sex trafficking, while 1,057 were about trafficking for forced labour.
Polaris noted that the most common ways of people being forced into sex trafficking last year were by a sexual partner or family member.

Nearly one in five homeless youths are victims of human trafficking.
This statistic was among the new findings from Loyola University New Orleans’ Modern Slavery Research Project. Between February 2014 and June 2016, members of the project conducted a full study on the prevalence of human trafficking on homeless youth.
Researchers partnered with Covenant House International, a satellite group of shelters for homeless youth. They interviewed participants aged between 17 and 25 from Covenant House sites in the United States and Canada.
Professor Laura Murphy led the project with help from student interns at Loyola and Tulane University, as an extension to a study she conducted with professors Rae Taylor and Christian Bolden in New Orleans two years ago. Murphy, Taylor and Bolden personally interviewed 99 homeless youth at the local Covenant House shelter and then replicated the same study in nine other cities: Atlanta; Anchorage, Alaska; Toronto; Vancouver; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Detroit; St. Louis; Oakland, California and Los Angeles. Student interns transcribed the interviews and then Murphy organized the findings into a report.
“My biggest hope is that people will see this as an economic problem that requires economic answers. We can send as many people to jail as we want, but until we have reasonable housing, jobs and a living wage for people who are down on their luck, those folks will continue to be vulnerable​ to traffickers,” Murphy said.
According to the report, a total of 641 homeless youth participated in the study. Of the youth who were interviewed, 19 percent were identified as victims of human trafficking. More than 14 percent had been trafficked for sex, eight percent were trafficked for labor and three percent were trafficked for both sex and labor. Of the participants, 91 percent reported being approached by someone offering an opportunity for income that was “too good to be true.”
Marley Duet, English sophomore, helped with the project as a research assistant. She helped mostly with transcribing interviews and coding them using a computer program.
According to the study, nearly 58 percent of participants who were identified as sex trafficking victims were in situations of force or coercion.
“The coercion factor comes in with homeless youth because a lot of them haven’t received much education, and also, they’re very young still, so they don’t have a lot of experience knowing their rights as a worker,” Duet said.
Lauren Stroh, cultural studies senior, also helped with the project research. Stroh called attention to important specific information she and other researchers discovered, particularly focusing on statistics involving youth within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
The study found 24 percent of LGBT youth interviewed were victims of sex trafficking versus 12 percent of non-LGBT youth.
The full report, “Labor and Sex Trafficking Among Homeless Youth,” is available online.

It’s easy to overlook homelessness as an LGBTQ issue—despite the fact that 43 percent of homeless youth in Washington identify as such, according to DC’s 2016 Homeless Youth Census. The reasons why LGBTQ youth end up without stable living situations vary widely. Some are kicked out by their families because of their sexual orientation or gender presentation, others face discrimination at school or the workplace.
“It’s like society punishes [these homeless LGBT youth] in every way possible for being different. The punishment is no jobs, no access to resources, no beds,” says Ruby Corado, executive director of LGBTQ homeless youth organization Casa Ruby. “A big part of my job is to restore their pride and dignity. It’s to tell them—when the world tells them they are demons—that ‘baby, they’re wrong.’”
The biggest cause of homelessness, regardless of sexual orientation, is poverty. Contrary to popular beliefs, LGBTQ people are poorer than the straight population; they’re also more likely to be female and people of color. And despite DC’s reputation as one of the most socially progressive cities in the United States, tales of discrimination against homeless trans youth abound beneath the surface.
“I think that this city is really very harsh with homeless people in general, but when it comes to LGBT, particularly trans people, this city is very intolerant,” Corado says. “This intolerance really affects how they’re treated at home and why they end up in the streets. These LGBT youth in the welfare system end up in mental health facilities.”
Impoverished people who have experienced discrimination simply don’t have the resources to bring a lawsuit. A lack of permanent phone number or fixed address makes it more difficult to find employment. Loitering or panhandling charges can rack up.
“Class differences are real,” Eddy Ameen, chair of the Youth Working Group at the DC Center for LGBT Community says. “The LGBT vibrancy that we take for granted over [in wealthier areas of DC] is less apparent in Wards 7 and 8, although there are LGBT people living there and undoubtedly thriving there.”
While the District has undertaken some steps—like a 2013 law setting aside shelter space for LGBTQ youth and increasing funding for homeless services by $1.3 million in 2015—resources specifically tailored for LGBTQ youth remain scarce. Even now, there are barely more than 60 shelter beds set aside for LGBTQ homeless people spread across city-run facilities, Casa Ruby, and the Wanda Alston Foundation. SMYAL, an service organization for LGBTQ youth, is opening transitional housing soon.
But that still leaves DC’s short nearly 100 beds. Of the 330 homeless youth counted in the 2016 survey, 142 identified as LGBTQ, and experts like Maggie Riden, who runs the DC Alliance of Youth Advocates, believe many more may be at risk of winding up on the streets. A 2011 study by Riden’s organization showed between 3,000 and 6,000 Washington youths are forced to leave their homes at some point each year, but may “couch surf” or not go to a shelter out of embarrassment or because they are full.
“We still are seeing particularly LGBTQ youth bullied and pushed out of school,” Riden says. “If you don’t have an education, everything—including your ability to have a good relationship with your parents—falters.”
DC also draws in LGBTQ youths from well beyond its borders, perhaps a credit to its reputation as a city with a thriving gay population. Corado estimates around 60 percent of her young clients come from outside of the District. Other factors could include the warm climate and the fact that DC’s health system offers coverage for trans health care, but there are no numbers yet to back up those hunches.
LGBTQ youth have specific needs. They are more likely to engage in sex work as a means of survival than their straight peers, which can leave them at risk for assault and human trafficking. They also have higher rates of substance abuse, self-harm, and mental-health concerns. Riden says city government employees at shelters and beyond could benefit from sensitivity training on how to deal with youth, in particular those who are LGBTQ. Since 2012, DC police officers have taken a 40-hour “Advancing Positive Youth Development Training,” and there’s talk of integrating it into to cadet training.
What homeless youth say they want most is a dependable adult in their lives—someone who isn’t paid to be there. Riden wants more LGBTQ people to step up as mentors. She says there’s a huge need for people to open their homes to youth who have been kicked out but are able to be reunited with their families, and need a place to stay in the interim.
“There’s still a lack of available resources to do better family work for when those family relations are reparable,” Riden says. “I think it would be incredible if there was a steady supply of LGBTQ adults who provided host homes or respites. That would give them time for family reunification. It’s been a struggle to find adults who are willing to go through the process.”
Riden says some adults are afraid to assist because they have an image of homeless youth as being “bad kids” or “gangbangers” who ran away to party and do drugs, not because they were fleeing for their safety. Ameen says its frustrating that with all the kerfuffle around same-sex marriage rights and bigoted bakers, life-or-death issues of the most vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community aren’t a priority.
“We need to remember the privilege that comes with being part of the housed class. Our LGBT movement started with homeless trans activists preceding Stonewall, and we’ve lost a little bit of sight of that,” Ameen says. “When you look at the amount of mobilization that there was around marriage equality—if we could just harness that energy, we could eradicate problems that affect vulnerable youth. God bless us all, but we really need to fight for each other.”


Heidi Ross was a senior in high school when she hitchhiked from the Anchorage suburb of Eagle River into the city, leaving a dark childhood behind.
“I didn’t have anywhere to go,” she said of that day, around 20 years ago. “I had the clothes on my back.”
After she arrived, without a way to pay rent, she soon found herself trading sex for a place to stay. Next she traded sex for drugs. Using sex to get things she needed made her feel powerful, she said. At 21, she went to work for a pimp who promised to take care of her.
“It felt strange at first, because I was so used to taking care of myself,” she said. “It felt good. It felt like a piece was missing and it had finally come back.”
Ross said sex work became her “lifestyle”. Eventually, however, she would be the one exploiting young men and women as adrift as she was on that ride into Anchorage.
Sexual exploitation has been an undercurrent of the state’s male-dominated frontier culture since Russian explorers first came to the region, and men flocked to the state during the Gold Rush. Law enforcement, prosecutors and victim advocates have long suspected the state has a high rate of sex trafficking, but the problem has been largely unstudied. Recently, though, a small study of trafficking among homeless youth offered some data to support these suspicions.

In April, researchers at Loyola University New Orleans released statistics based on interviews with youths aged 17 to 25 at Covenant House youth shelters and other service centers in 10 cities across the country. They found that Anchorage had the highest percentage of respondents – more than one in four of the 65 interviewees – who reported being trafficked for sex or labor. The average among shelters was roughly one in five.
The definition of trafficking in the study is “exploitation of a person’s labor through force, fraud or coercion”. The study found that 27% of young women interviewed at the Anchorage shelter and 17% of young men reported being trafficked for sex. LGBT youth were more likely to be victims. Most of the youth who said they had been trafficked, or engaged in sex in exchange for housing, were homeless at the time.
There is a demand for sex and there are sexually vulnerable people who can be swooped up
Josh Louwerse, youth engagement worker
Alaska consistently leads the nation in rates of child abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, homelessness and substance abuse. Being a victim of violence or sexual assault or having a substance abuse problem increases the risk someone will be trafficked, said Josh Louwerse, youth engagement program coordinator at Covenant House in Anchorage. So does homelessness, he said.
According to Louwerse, every young client at the shelter has experienced trauma. Many have been victimized and abandoned by their parents and let down by government systems set up to protect them. About 40% of the youth served by the shelter serves have a mental health diagnosis. More that half are Alaska Native, some from villages in rural Alaska.
Alaska’s economy is built on a host of industries that employ younger, single men, including oil, fishing and the military, Louwerse said. A robust tourism industry also fuels the sex trade. “There is a demand for sex and there are sexually vulnerable people who can be swooped up and manipulated to deliver that sex,” he said. “We have all these places around the state that are essentially hubs.”

Jolene Goeden, an FBI agent who handles trafficking investigations, said her agency monitors sex ads online and sees an uptick during tourist season. People pay more for sex in Alaska than other places, she said, and she has seen cases where traffickers have brought women into the state for this reason. Alaska Native women can be attractive to traffickers because they can be marketed as several different races.
The cost of sex in Alaska is between $200 and $300 an hour, she said. Out-of-state traffickers might send several women there at a time. If each of them saw three clients in a day – a low estimate – it wouldn’t take long to cover hotel costs and airfare.
“Every day thereafter is all profit,” she said.
If you’ve never had somebody take notice of you, say you’re beautiful, you’re smart, you’ll do a lot to hold on to that
Heidi Ross, sex trafficker
The high cost of housing in Alaska is also implicated in trafficking, she added. A person making minimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment at market rent, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “One of our biggest factors to overcome with the majority of victims, I would say, is stable housing and affordable housing,” she said. “I would say there is no such thing.”
In the years before she left home, Ross said, she was caring for her mother who suffered from schizophrenia. She worked late every night at the local movie theater and a Wendy’s to help pay bills. One day at school, she threw a book at a teacher and walked out. Not long after, she was in a stranger’s car headed for Anchorage.
“I couldn’t do it anymore,” she said. “I broke.”
She says that as the years passed, she took on administrative duties in sex businesses and had relationships with the pimps who ran them. She’s never had a boyfriend outside of the sex trade. Her longest-term relationship was with a violent pimp named Troy Williams.

Young people, Ross found, came to her from rough childhoods with nowhere to live, substance abuse problems and lots of emotional needs. She knew they weren’t afraid of getting physically hurt as much as they were afraid of being cut off, she said. They wanted love more than money. This was something she found she could take advantage of.


“If you’ve never had somebody take notice of who you are and say you’re beautiful, say you’re smart, say you’re kind,” she said. “You’ll do a lot to hold on to that.”
Eventually she became a “lieutenant” in a trafficking business. In 2015, the state charged Ross and Williams with multiple counts related to sex trafficking. She is completing a brief sentence after pleading guilty to running an operation in exchange for fewer charges.
Williams, meanwhile, went to trial, where women testified about beatings, and about being denied food and forced into ice baths when they wouldn’t work. Ross says she never saw such treatment. Williams, who is also the father of her only child, was convicted on several counts and is awaiting sentencing.
Now 37 and using a new name she did not want to disclose, Ross is holding down a fast food job, hoping to regain custody of her son. She plans to move to Arizona and find employment in the restaurant business. Sex work is lucrative compared to the other kinds of work she’s qualified for, but she said she won’t go back.
“Because of what I would lose,” she said. “I want my son, I want out.”

Nathan Earl—and many more like him—have a story to share. He is a survivor of commercial sexual exploitation.
“I was sexually and physically abused when I was very young. The perpetrators were family members, so the protection aspect when I was little, it just didn’t exist,” the Sarasota resident says. “I was going through issues with my own sexuality, and all of this put together, I just felt like I was a mistake. I was initially too scared to run to the streets, so at 11 years old I started sniffing gasoline in the garage as a way to escape reality.
“The sexual abuse lasted until I was around 14 or 15. I transitioned to pills, then pot, booze, cocaine, all in an attempt to numb myself.”
At 19, Earl was accepted to the University of Florida. But, he says, the years of abuse and lack of opportunity to process all that happened eventually caught up with him, and everything came crashing down.
“I ended up strung out on crack and crystal meth, I was homeless, subjected to brutal violence on the street,” he says. “My body was dumped in Sarasota out along the tree-line by the airport after I was out hustling one night. You couldn’t even recognize my face. I woke up with no shirt, pants undone, and there were several instances of that type of violence in my life.”
He says he was arrested numerous times and things continued to get worse. But after his last arrest, he reached a turning point.
“One of the counselors mentioned a quote by Viktor Frankl which says, ‘If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering,’” he says. “I could barely speak at this point, but for some reason, that quote stuck. I made this decision that if I don’t do anything about this, if I don’t say anything about this, then it just ends up as this twisted thing that happened, and how horrible would that be?
“So that’s when I made that transition from victim to survivor.”
A decade later, Earl has found his destiny and purpose as founder of Ark Of Freedom, a nonprofit anti-human trafficking corporation headquartered in Manatee County. And he hopes things will begin to change, as programs get developed and the media brings the plight of these victims to light.

It’s not gender-specific
Human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation are inarguably some of the most heinous acts committed worldwide, only really entering society’s human rights lexicon over the course of the last decade. And while these atrocities are becoming a more widely known and discussed set of topics, they still remain on the periphery of the national and international consciousness. They are often categorized and painted with the broad strokes of generalizations—the idea that “trafficking” and “sexual exploitation” refer exclusively to sexual slavery of primarily women, and occur in other countries.
While that picture alone still struggles to spark enough global action to eradicate these crimes, there is a subset within the trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation population that receives essentially no media coverage. There have been only a handful of national level studies published about male victims. There is a huge gap in victim identification, prevention education and counseling in regards to them. And yet they make up nearly half of the commercially sexually exploited and trafficked youth population.
“The Department of Justice published three studies—one was in New York, one was North America in general, and one was Florida-based—and all three stated that, depending on region, anywhere from 30-50% of sex trafficked kids are male,” says Earl.
“Domestically, around 100,000 youths are trafficked every year, so even if you’re looking at the most conservative estimates of 30%, that’s 30,000 boys,” says Earl. “Within that, what also often gets diluted in that figure is the subset of LGBT, which are the most marginalized.”
Officially, trafficking is  defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.
Commercial sexual exploitation is officially defined as sexual activity in which one party is engaged in order to obtain food, shelter, clothing or other basic needs that result from a vulnerable state of being.
Florida ranks 3rd in trafficking cases
Florida currently ranks third in the nation for number of human trafficking cases, and a victim will only survive an average of six years without being identified and taken into care. Why does Florida rank so high?
“Number one is the tourism,” says Earl. “Any time you have transient populations, it makes this kind of activity easier—they can’t be tracked, they’re invisible.
“When you have these clandestine operations going on, it becomes easier to hide in these areas, and you have the amusement parks, and you have family vacations where there are children.”
Earl explains that the question often raised is, why don’t law enforcement officials step in to intervene, and furthermore, why don’t the victims self-report and escape the situation?
The Safe Harbor Act in Florida empowers law enforcement to refer a youth who they feel is at risk for sex trafficking or exploitation. Instead of taking a youth to jail on an arrest charge, they can instead refer them directly to an agency.
“But what’s happening is that they’re getting arrested for things like loitering or panhandling, and instead of being referred to services, they’re being viewed as criminals instead of victims,” says Earl. “The other part of this is that males are considered invisible in this scenario because boys are thought to be more in charge and have more agency and control, those are our cultural perceptions. So if something like this happens to you, you don’t self-report because if you identify as straight, people will think you’re gay. If you identify as gay, people will think you brought it on yourself.”

Living in shame
“The shame that many male survivors feel, as well as the fear of how others perceive them, plays a large part in why many do not share what has happened to them,” says nonprofit international human rights organization Love146’s US Programs Director Kimberly Casey. “When we ask males what prevented them from coming forward, we hear things like, ‘I’m supposed to want sex all the time,’ ‘They’d think I’m weak,’ ‘I didn’t want them to think I was gay.’
“The discussion of victimization in the United States is a difficult thing, regardless of gender. There has been no shortage of voices standing on top of the ‘victim blaming’ soapbox—for women. As we’ve begun to listen to male survivors, it is clear that this platform must be shared.”
But beyond these obstacles, there are far more severe physical and psychological factors that put these youths on the path to victimization, and keep them invisible.
In 2014, Love146 published a report authored by Timothy A. Bastedo entitled The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Male Minors in the United States: A Snapshot with Strategic Implications for Prevention Education, which aimed at generating male-specific content for the organization’s Prevention Education Curriculum. In it, Bastedo reports that the “commercially exploited male minors paradigmatically engage in survival sex as a response to homelessness,” the primary cause of which is family dysfunction, including physical and sexual abuse, and the pervasion of drugs.
“Whether a voluntary or involuntary exit of the home, male minors are at the highest risk to find themselves lacking food, shelter, clothing and other basic necessities,” Bastedo writes. “And it is estimated as many as 45% choose to engage in sexual activity to meet their basic needs.”
Earl outlines the circumstances and experiences of the average commercially exploited male minor (CSEMM).
“The pathway to exploitation is pretty much the same across the board,” he says. “It starts somewhere around 4 to 5 years old with family dysfunction where they are being physically or sexually abused at home, the parents are on drugs, the kids then end up on drugs, living in poverty. And even at 9 or 10 years old, there’s the ‘fight or flight’ reaction, and so most will either escape through drugs or escape to the streets. Either way, the outcome is not good.
“So we have runaways, but we also have throwaways. About 26-30% of gay youths are still thrown out to the streets, and when that happens, survival mode kicks in—you don’t have any food, you don’t have any shelter, when the drugs take hold it becomes even harder.”
Earl explains the progression to the next step of the victimization process.
“The average age of becoming sexually exploited for a male is around 11-12 years old,” he says. “When you run to the streets, you only have a few options. You can run to a foster home, and while things are changing with foster homes now, many are still not trauma-informed relating to trafficking-specific issues, and the poly-victimization that these kids go through. Many times you’re further abused in foster care, so you run away from foster care maybe five or six times.”
Adult homeless shelters aren’t always an option either, Earl says.
“You say, ‘Ok, forget foster care, I’ll go to the Salvation Army,’” Earl explains. “With adult homeless shelters, the incidents of further molestation, victimization and recruiting out of those shelters into human trafficking is very high. They don’t have the staffing, they aren’t culturally competent, they don’t know what to look for and there’s no real screening process to differentiate between someone with deviant behavior and someone in a position of, ‘Hey I lost my job and I’m just down on my luck.’ The perpetrators in these scenarios are pedophiles, which pertains to prepubescent, hebephiles, which pertains to post-pubescent, or situational abusers who are sex addicts. And it doesn’t matter whether girl, boy, it’s just the younger they are, they are perceived as safer from disease.”
Earl explains that by this point, the CSEMM has already spent the majority of his life being abused and exploited.
“By around 14 you say, ‘I’ll just stay on the streets,’ and by now you’ve learned you can have your necessary survival needs met by selling yourself,” Earl says. “And with that comes a sense of empowerment in the ability to decide how much to charge.”
Bastedo’s report identifies this misguided mentality of empowerment within the CSEMM populous as well, stating that “once male minors become homeless, they are most frequently recruited into sexually exploitive activities by peers or potential customers. These relationships tend to be less overtly coercive than female-pimp relationships.” CSEMMs will oftentimes report believing they have the ability to extricate themselves from situations and relationships they no longer want to be a part of, thus rebranding their exploitation as a “hustle,” creating the illusion of control.
“Now you’re 15-16, by this time you’re probably so strung out on meth or crack, you have to get your fix just to get up and function,” Earl continues. “So you’re starting to make this transition where you’re so scarred emotionally that if you’ve survived that long, by around 18 you begin to transition into being a facilitator. They’ll rent a small apartment, recruit other guys to come in, and act as the facilitator.”
The basic structure and pathway to victimization plays out nearly identically to Earl’s outline when survivors share their personal stories.
Case in point, Ira Lee Baker of Tampa.
A survivor’s story
A survivor of commercial sexual exploitation, Baker explains that he was a victim of abuse from early childhood.
When I was around 6 or 7 years old, the incest and sexual abuse began,” says Baker. “When I was 8, I ran away from home and hitchhiked from Tallahassee to Tampa and was introduced to prostitution. At that time, they didn’t do anything about [prostitution], you could lie about your age when you got arrested, tell a story and back then there wasn’t really a way of proving your age or your identity.
“I had a pimp and he was aware of my real age, and he would dress me up like a girl and I would go out and walk up and down Kennedy Boulevard and turn tricks.”
Baker explains this continued until he was 11, when he was picked up by law enforcement and returned to his family in Tallahassee.
“My biological mother hated the fact that I was gay,” he says. “The only time it was okay for me to be gay was when these older men wanted to pay her to take me for the evening. It was dinner, then back to a hotel room, and that’s when the sex would begin.”
Baker recalls being put into school at 13—an environment he could not relate to, nor was safe in.
“I just couldn’t identify with any of the kids there,” he says. “I was ridiculed for being feminine. In the boys’ bathrooms I had boys that were older than me that would force me to have sex with them, then abuse and ridicule me in public.”
He says his life was a continuous cycle of prostitution and jail. By 17, Baker was addicted to drugs, and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.
“In prison, it’s the same thing,” he says. “An older guy kind of becomes your pimp in prison and you’re offered out for a certain amount of money. And that cycle just kept going on until I was around 35 years old.”
Unfortunately, Baker’s story isn’t unique.
“These victims have been treated like crap since they were 3 or 4 years old, they’re taught that they’re worthless,” says Earl. “When you reach 12-13 years old, you’re already vulnerable because of your age, and you’re still developing. There is a rationalization of saying ‘No, I can control [my circumstances],’ but the internal feelings of shame and stigma, the drug addiction and abuse, it’s all still there.”
One of the most at-risk segments of the LGBT community for trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation is the transgender population, and as Earl explains, “It’s really because when adapting to adverse conditions, it becomes a lot harder when there’s a weaker sense of identity. So if you’re talking about someone who is 13 or 14 years old, naturally at a vulnerable state anyway, and then you factor in the identity crisis that comes into play with young LBGT, it poses a more complex situation.”

Finding the wrong kind of acceptance
Torri Ramos is a Central Florida transgender survivor of commercial sexual exploitation, and she says her story began during her teenage years when she realized she wasn’t accepted by her family.
“My family was very religious, they really didn’t approve of me. I didn’t have anybody,” says Ramos. “I felt really in the dark and vulnerable. I was introduced to the streets and it gave me a feeling of being accepted and belonging. From there I was introduced to prostitution, and in this weird way I almost felt a sense of happiness because I was desired.”
Ramos soon found her situation changing from bad to worse.
“I was introduced to someone who offered to help me out. I had to work for them, they took my money, they were taking advantage of me. There were nights I was so tired I didn’t want to go out to the streets, but they would force me. It was really bad.”
Earl says there’s a word for such treatment: organized crime.
“This is syndicated activity. It’s very clandestine, and there are very intricate networks. “Online places like Adam4Adam, Grindr, Backpage, Craigslist—these are major recruitment channels. The majority [of victims] do come from the vulnerable and homeless populations, and we see recruiting from shelters, foster homes, bus stops, the streets, adult bookstores. But there are a significant number of mainstream American kids who are lured through Facebook, Myspace, these online channels,” he says.
Any youth already experiencing feelings of loneliness or a lack of self-identification are targeted online.
“There are plenty of perpetrators out there who look for that online, befriend you, eventually set up a meeting, and that’s when they can forcibly kidnap, and you’re pimped,” Earl says. “Or there’s the psychological coercion, where one may be convinced through these feelings of love, ‘If you love me, you’ll do this.’ We know of situations where there are brothels and circuit parties where people are literally chained to a wall, gagged and forced to ingest drugs.”
The disconcerting facts and figures of the trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation world is compounded when one learns that there are virtually zero services available for victimized males, as Bastedo’s report points out the troubling fact that “there are no prevention education or prevention services for male minors at high-risk for commercial sexual exploitation.”
“Research has to be conducted, and funding for programs across the nation has to be sourced,” says Earl. “It takes a unified message from anti-trafficking providers to identify all victims.”

Patience then healing
When dealing with the trauma endured by a survivor, Earl explains that the rehabilitation process needs to be long term, and comprehensive.
“It’s not an instant thing, they run back to the streets, not because it’s safe, but because it’s just what is known and what is familiar. So programs have to take that into account and design protocol that understands they are going to run and have an open door policy that they can come back,” he says. “The initial part is stabilization, and what that means is immediate safety by means of shelter, getting them off the street and away from the facilitator, a drug detox, food, and clothing. Once you meet those immediate tangible needs, you can work towards the restorative transitional aspect, and you start to meet their intangible needs and connect them to a formal economy through education and vocational rehabilitation.”
There is also a need for improving life and social skills among this population as well as finding appropriate nutritional education and financial literacy. Earl says the process can take up to 24 months.
He explains that even the most basic skills are likely to be lacking in a survivor victim.
A collaborative effort
Baker and Ramos are now part of Nathan Earl’s cause, both on the road to recovery and with plans to aid Ark Of Freedom as survivor mentors.
“Until all the areas of trauma are addressed, you won’t have success,” says Baker, who has since been adopted by a family, and is currently working on his own path to recovery and stabilization. “When it comes to men, society tends to say, ‘You could fight back, you could run away. Where is there to run? Where is there to go? You feel mentally and spiritually trapped. You try to go to school or trying to have a normal life, the anxiety level is overwhelming, and the intensity of the fear is above and beyond.”
But to escape, one must find his or her voice.
“People have to speak out, it won’t be addressed if no one is talking about it,” says Ramos, who was a friend of Earl’s when both were on the street, and, in a twist of fate, was recently reunited with him by a chance encounter.
“We need more people to report, especially within the gay community,” Ramos says. “Otherwise it’s going to remain hush-hush and it’s never going to be dealt with.”
Casey agrees with these assertions.
“The dominant image of masculinity in the United States renders ‘male victims’ a seemingly incongruous description,” she says. “Many Americans still associate human trafficking with young girls locked in brothels in developing countries. At Love146, we know that narrative to be true, however we also know that human trafficking and exploitation is incredibly complex, and that those being exploited don’t always fit our image of victimization at first glance.”
There is still plenty of research to be done and there is an obvious lack in statistics concerning young boys trapped in a life they never wanted. The only way to boost that research is through reporting the crime.
“When you want to end the marginalization of a particular group or population, you have to empower the population,” Earl says. “[Ark Of Freedom’s] mission is to educate, empower and mobilize communities in the battle to end the trafficking of youth, while restoring, enhancing and empowering the lives of trafficked or exploited youth and young adults. The second part of our mission is to decrease the marginalization of male victims through community awareness and education, community outreach training and through the provision of male-specific, victim-centered, trauma-informed safe housing and other restorative supportive services.”
Casey echoes Earl’s sentiment on the need for a shift in society’s perceptions regarding victimization.
“The domestic violence movement has found success in their efforts to challenge people to stop asking, ‘Why did you stay?’ and encourage the exploration of the larger societal influences that contributed to a person’s victimization,” she says. “Similarly, rather than asking ‘Why do you keep doing this to yourself?’ we need a collective shout that considers the complex vulnerabilities and circumstances that contribute to the commercial sexual exploitation of male minors.”
And that means collaboration.
“Human trafficking and exploitation is a global heinous crime, and there’s no way that one person or one agency is going to make a difference across the globe,” says Earl. “What it takes is us all joining the fight, assuming our roles, and being a voice.”

Just a few blocks east of the gleaming glass office buildings and new lofts of downtown Los Angeles, the streets make an abrupt change from vegan bakeries and Starbucks to sidewalks lined with trash, shopping carts stuffed with belongings and people sleeping in tents. This is Skid Row, where 2,000 homeless take up a 54-block radius, forming what is the largest homeless encampment in the United States.
It's a warm summer evening in July, and Lt. Andre Dawson of the Los Angeles Police Department is steering his blacked-out SUV across South Los Angeles Street. Skid Row is an emblem of L.A.’s notorious designation as the nation's unsheltered homeless capital: the city has 82,000 homeless on any given night, and most people don't realize that up to one in eight of the homeless are unaccompanied minors, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty at the Weingart Center.
Dawson, 56, is stylish and well-spoken. He’s wearing a pink button-down shirt with dark jeans, reflective sunglasses and a mustache that he is in the habit of smoothing with one hand. Dawson has been a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department for 33 years, and since 2010, he’s run the LAPD team dedicated to stopping child commercial sex exploitation.
While headlines tout stories of women and children trafficked from overseas, Dawson says you need look no further than the streets of Los Angeles to find America’s sexually exploited kids. Over 90 percent of children under 18 rescued by his team are “domestic cases,” he says, meaning they are kids born and raised in America. And they have not been kidnapped and stuffed into the back of a van, which is Hollywood's version of sex trafficking.
“It’s not what everybody thinks; it’s not what the movies tell you it is,” says Dawson. “What we see are — what’s the term to refer to girls that nobody cares about? Throwaway kids.”
It's a term used to describe the thousands of children in America who are abandoned, abused, neglected and often in and out of foster care. Although “orphan” isn’t a term we use anymore in the United States, Dawson sees sexually exploited kids who are essentially without families, or without reliable, safe homes, day in and day out.
There are between 4,800 and 10,000 homeless minors in Los Angeles on any given night, most of them concentrated around downtown L.A. and Hollywood, and many find themselves in a Dickensian scramble to survive. Some come from out of state, in search of warm weather and a better life, but most are local kids from Southern California’s poor neighborhoods. Many will fall into, or be pressed into, sex work.
Exact stats on minors in the sex trade are dicey — information is hard to get and tough to confirm. One oft-quoted but unverified figure says that one in three teens will be recruited into sex work the first 48 hours on the street according to the National Runaway Switchboard. Another embattled University of Pennsylvania study claimed that most kids enter the sex trade at age 13; a more recent peer-reviewed 2008 report puts the average age at 15. What is known is that homeless teens, at any age, are vulnerable.
The federal definition for what constitutes trafficking is broader than most people realize. While “trafficked” implies transportation of victims across borders, anyone compelled to perform commercial sex acts by force, fraud or coercion is legally defined as a trafficking victim. Therefore, anyone under age 18 performing commercial sex acts is considered a trafficking victim because they aren’t old enough to give consent—whether or not there is evidence of force or coercion.
Rather than treated as victims that need help, most children in the sex trade have been arrested on prostitution charges and put behind bars while their adult johns usually get off scot-free. Dawson’s CSEC (Commercially Sexually Exploited Children) unit is one of the first in the country to adopt a “first responders” protocol that trains officers to recognize and talk to minors and bring them into the station to put them in touch with social services, instead of landing them in juvenile court.
Dawson knows there's no silver bullet solution to stopping sex trafficking. But it's a step forward for law enforcement, and a model for cities across the country.
The tracks
It’s just after 5 p.m., and the sun is still high in Southern California’s hazy sky. Dawson heads toward "the tracks" in Compton, or what locals call “the Blade,” stretches of city streets where sex is sold. This is the time of day when women will hit the sidewalks looking to pick up guys who are just getting off work, Dawson says. They will walk up and down streets like Figueroa Avenue, which is lined with strip malls, liquor stores and cheap hotels, while working cellphones, talking to their pimps and looking out for regulars and new customers.
The sidewalks in South Central are thick with foot traffic, from kids who are out of school to shift workers waiting for buses. As we crawl up Figueroa Avenue in rush-hour traffic, Dawson calls out the action on the street.
“She’s working,” he nods toward a woman strolling casually in spandex leggings and a not-especially revealing striped top. “Those two are working.” He points out two young women, one black and one Latina, walking past a McDonald’s, who appear to be in their late teens or early twenties. They're wearing stretchy jeans and crop tops and talking on their cellphones through their earbuds.
When Dawson’s team does recon on the street, they’re scanning young women and looking for underage girls. It takes a trained eye to tell the difference between a sixteen-year old and an eighteen-year old, but sometimes it’s painfully obvious that a child is on the street—the youngest girl Dawson has rescued from the street was ten years old. Dawson's team will also pose as johns on social media to bust pimps that are trafficking children online, gather intelligence from informants, and try to persuade victims to testify against their traffickers.
When Dawson suspects someone on the street is underage, he approaches her and introduces himself as an officer from the trafficking unit, and notes that her behavior has been consistent with commercial sex activity in the neighborhood. Then, instead of arresting her, he takes her into custody to put her in touch with social services.
Until recently, “child prostitutes,” a term that Dawson, and anti-trafficking advocates recoil at, were seen as willful criminals instead of victims.
It's hard to know how many minors are involved in trading sex, because a teenager coming to a shelter or nonprofit in crisis won’t usually say they need help because they’re being trafficked.
“They say, ‘I need food, or I need a place to sleep.’ They may report that they are trading sex, or not," says Johannah Westmacott of Safe Horizon, an anti-trafficking and homeless drop-in center.
Dawson’s perspective has changed over the years; he has brought in girls who were abused and exploited by pimps but faced worse trauma in foster care, or homes plagued by abuse, drugs and poverty.
And many of the young women and girls “in the life,” the insider term for sex work, have a history of abuse at home or in the foster care system before they ever end up on the tracks. Forty-six percent of runaway and homeless youths report having being physically abused, and 17 percent report being forced into unwanted sexual activity by a family or household member, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
This is part of what advocates call the “foster care to prostitution pipeline” that sets kids up from a childhood of abuse into a future in sex work.
“There’s a conversation to be had that a lot of these adult women were just kids that never got rescued,” Dawson says. “Now it’s all they know.”
First responders
When Dawson’s unit picks up a minor, after contacting DCFS, they call someone from Amber Davies’ team. Davies works for Saving Innocence, a Los Angeles advocacy and outreach nonprofit founded in 2010 by Kim Biddle, who is herself a child survivor of commercial sexual exploitation. Within 90 minutes, one of the five caseworkers— all women — will be on the scene to meet with the child.
An example of a typical young woman that Davies has met with is a 14-year-old girl, African-American, who has been in foster care since age 9 and has a history of sexual abuse. But girls like this aren’t usually rejoicing to be “rescued.” In fact, they are usually afraid of law enforcement and attached to their pimp, who often plays simultaneous roles of exploiter and boyfriend/father figure.
“What we hear from youths is that they’ve had bad experiences with law enforcement before, and it’s hard to talk about what they’ve been through,” says Davies. And the girls themselves report that law enforcement officers are “tricks,” or trade sexual favors in exchange for avoiding arrest. "So if they bring us in and we say these officers are the good guys, it helps immensely."
Davies' team tries to create a safe relationship with teenagers using “their language.” “I’ll say, ‘I have not been in the life but I want to understand what you’ve been through.’”
Saving Innocence is part of an innovative initiative called First Responders Protocol for CSEC. Initiated by the Long Beach Police Department, it’s one of the first of its kind. Just a few years ago, Long Beach, home of the notorious Long Beach Boulevard track, had the highest number of arrests of minors in the sex trade in Los Angeles. Last year, it had zero.
Now, minors detained by police are connected to services like Davies’ instead of put behind bars. While Long Beach has been praised for this progressive protocol, all 50 states, including California, have sentencing laws that criminalize minors for “juvenile prostitution” rather than treating them as child-abuse victims.
Malika Saada Saar is executive director of advocacy group Rights4Girls, which launched the No Such Thing campaign earlier this year to end arrests for so-called “child prostitution.”
“In California and almost every other state, trafficked kids — the majority of them black and brown — are contemplated and treated as criminals,” Saada Saar said in a press conference, “when in fact they have been subjected to repeated commercial rape.”
“There is no such thing as a child prostitute, there are only victims and survivors of child rape.”
A clean, well-lighted place
The teen girl who gets kidnapped and sold into sex trafficking does exist—but it’s a very small percentage of cases. What advocates call the “kidnapped innocent girl narrative” makes up about 10 percent of cases according to Alexandra Lutnick, a researcher at RTI San Francisco who specializes in young people and the sex trade. The rest of sex trafficking cases are “more complicated.”
“To only focus on the one narrative pulls heartstrings, but it does a disservice to other youth who can benefit from resources and support,” says Lutnick, who points out that most of these kids aren’t like Elizabeth Smart—the 14-year-old Salt Lake City girl whose 2002 kidnapping from her home set off a national search. They can't be rescued and returned to loving homes.
Westmacott agrees. The story of a trapped white, middle class girl from the suburbs can be compelling and get laws passed. "But that leads to solutions that do nothing for a person running away from an abusive group home, or LGBT youth that has nowhere to stay."
The girls that Davies meets with, for example, often come from a family where she was already being sexually abused. “A child is already being molested or raped by a stepfather or abused in foster care, and then an older guy comes along and pays to get their nails done, hair done, takes them to McDonald’s. Nobody has treated them that well,” she says.
A minor in that situation is choosing between what she sees as the better of two bad options. She may not see her relationship with her pimp, or “Daddy,” or “boyfriend” as abusive, or she may not realize it until he threatens her, or threatens to hurt her family.
“We want them to understand that help is out there — their pimp has told them time and again that nobody cares for you or understands you, you’re just going to end up in jail,” says Davies. “We don’t want that to be true. We want to make sure that their pimps are liars.”
Unfortunately, it’s harder for Davies to help victims than it should be. After she meets with a girl, she will try to find a place for her to stay. There aren’t many. Shelters have long waiting lists, and few allow unaccompanied minors. “The Youth Welcome Center [the Los Angeles County youth shelter] is the county equivalent of a flophouse,” says Davies. “It’s a bunch of mattresses thrown on the floor.”
The need for foster homes outstrips demand by 30 percent nationally. An L.A. Times reportearlier this year found that shelter social workers made up to 100 phone calls to place a single child in foster care, and staff were concerned that traffickers were recruiting from the youth shelter itself.
As a result, a lot of kids in shelters run back to the street. A 14-year-old is a child, after all, and between sleeping on the floor alone with strangers, and going back to the life she knows — she will often choose the second. Most kids “in the life” will run anywhere from three to seven times before they leave the streets, says Davies. That might improve if they had a decent place to stay.
Nowhere to call home
Covenant House Los Angeles is in Hollywood, just a few miles from Mann’s Chinese Theater and the Walk of Stars, where tourists pose for sidewalk photos next to the name of Taylor Swift or Angelina Jolie.
Covenant House is a shelter and outreach center for homeless youth, with 94 beds. The vacancy rate is zero, and last month the waiting list had 100 names on it.
Bill Bedrossian is the executive director at Covenant House California, and if you ask him what would abate sex exploitation of young people, one answer is simple: beds.
Covenant House is on a short list of places that law enforcement calls when it is trying to place young people living on the street. “They have a scared kid from Idaho who they found in front of a store, or at the train station, or on Skid Row; that’s not a safe place for a young person to be,” he says.
About 65 to 70 percent of the youths Covenant House serves are locals from L.A. County, about 30 percent are from other states. Nearly all are coming from foster care, or are running from abuse, he says.
Bedrossian says he has trouble placing the youth that walk in his door or are sent to him by police. On average, it can take about six weeks for a bed to open up at Covenant House, or to find a bed in another handful of youth centers like this.
In the meantime, young people are on the street. “I had an 18-year old come in the other day that I had to waitlist, and he said he preferred the stairwell to adult homeless shelters that are not safe, and people are getting raped there."
Many kids on the street that are trading sex are involved in “survival sex,” which refers to youths trading sex for a place to sleep, or money for basics like food. In 2009, Chicago's Young Women's Empowerment Project for girls in the sex trade conducted its own research, and found that while 35 of 200 respondents said that they had been pimped or trafficked, 119 had engaged in survival sex.
At the Los Angeles LGBT Center in Hollywood, sexual health classes for homeless youths openly address survival sex and “harm reduction.” In Hollywood, many homeless youths include boys and transgender youths who trade sex for money, or for a place to stay.
A 2015 Urban Institute study found that young people who engaged in survival sex used the money to buy food first. Covenant House did a study with Fordham University in 2013 that interviewed 200 homeless youth, and found that almost half—48 percent—of those that traded sex did so because they didn’t have a place to stay.
What this says is that even those who aren’t pimped depend on sex to survive, says Johannah Westmacott of Safe Horizon. “We’re talking about the basics — food, shelter.”
Money. Food. A place to sleep.
As the sun starts to set over South Central, the sky turns a brilliant pink, and the action on the street picks up as Dawson and I cruise Long Beach Boulevard. He spots two women standing on a corner — one black, wearing a miniskirt, and one white wearing tall boots.
Dawson pulls into a parking lot where we can watch them discreetly with binoculars. A green late-model Lexus pulls up and the black woman walks up to the car. “That’s her pimp,” Dawson announces. How does he know? “She’s not negotiating with him, she’s just getting right into his car.”
Dawson flips around and stomps on the gas to give chase, then, once we catch up, he eases off to act natural. When we pull up to the light we can see that the driver is a woman, which Dawson identifies as the pimp’s "bottom," or right-hand help. “Or, that’s the pimp,” he says. “Don’t assume a pimp is always a man. Some of the meanest pimps I’ve ever met have been women.”
The woman in the passenger seat looks young, but not under 18. If she did, Dawson could pull them over, citing the burned out left tail light, and ID them both. But this approach can make for tough work busting pimps and identifying underage victims.
Dawson tells me, not for the first time, a story about a 10-year-old girl he rescued several years ago that really affected him. He rescued a 15-year-old earlier this year — and it was the same girl. She was back in the life. “That one really got to me,” he says.
Even Dawson is aware of the limited role of law enforcement in helping sexually exploited kids. When I asked Westmacott from Safe Horizon what the young people she works with ask for most, the answer is so obvious that a smile almost plays on her lips. “Money. A place to sleep. Food. Better economic opportunities.”
Dawson’s philosophy on long-term solutions to child trafficking is about the same. “Kids need a safe place to be and someone who cares about them. Now why should that be so hard?”
“My first time on the streets, I was approached at a bus stop. The pimp was nice, buying me things and letting me stay with him. He had a lot of girls coming and going. The second time I was taken to a house with windows covered. There were six or seven girls there naked, some had been there for days or months. I was injected with drugs and was forced to work even when pregnant. This house was on the North side. I was able to fake a stomach ache and my pimp dropped me off at the hospital.”
These haunting experiences come from a victim of sexual exploitation, shared during a survey with Beth Holger-Ambrose that was eventually published in the Journal of Child Sexual Abuse in 2013. Having worked in the field for 18 years, formerly with the Minnesota Department of Human Services and now as the executive director of The Link, an organization working with youth dealing with homelessness, truancy, and the juvenile legal system, Holger-Ambrose has heard countless accounts of sexual exploitation of youth, when someone under the age of 18 engages in commercial sexual activity.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health, commercial sexual activity occurs when anything of value or a promise of anything of value (such as money, drugs, food, shelter, rent, or social status) is given to a person by any means in exchange for any type of sexual activity. A third party may or may not be involved.
Holger-Ambrose will tell you, the personal story shared by a young woman in her survey is by no means the only one. One study estimates as many as 325,000 children in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico are at risk each year for becoming victims of sexual exploitation. Of those, a vast portion are taken advantage of while experiencing homelessness, with numbers ranging from study to study, one of which estimates 30 percent of shelter youth and 70 percent of street youth are victims of commercial sexual exploitation.
These youth may engage or be coerced into prostitution for “survival sex” to meet daily needs for food, shelter, or drugs. Other terms that may be used to talk about sexual exploitation are “child prostitution” and “youth sex trade.” Many sexually exploited youth face realities of drug use, homelessness, past trauma, and other factors which have lead them into the survival sex trade. Other youth may have no such history and may have been lured, tricked, or forced into being sexually exploited.
Commander Robert Thomasser oversees the St. Paul Police Department’s human trafficking department, and he makes no bones about it: anyone can fall victim to sexual exploitation. Rich or poor, becoming involved in “the life,” as it’s called, can entice youth of any background.
“Sexual exploitation can occur in any community,” he says. “When people think of the topic of human trafficking, they think of this image of a third world country, probably a young girl in chains smuggled on some boat or something. What we are trying to do is break down that stereotypical image and say that this can happen to any child. Regardless of their financial background, their religious background, their sexual orientation, anything. Everybody is vulnerable to this.”
Speaking from her personal experience, Holger-Ambrose notices higher rates of GLBT youth falling victim to sexual exploitation than their heterosexual counterparts. Citing homelessness, running away from home multiple times, and being in the foster care system as the biggest risk factors, Holger-Ambrose says, “Unfortunately, since we see higher rates of LGBTQ youth in the population of homeless youth, then we also are seeing similar rates within the youth who are being sexually exploited.”
The Minnesota Human Trafficking Task Force, operated out of the Minnesota Department of Health, also notes that GLBT youth are an over-represented sub-population within victims of sexual exploitation. Various studies have found that between 20 and 40 percent of unaccompanied homeless youth identify as GLBT, compared to three to five percent of the general youth population, while one local Minneapolis study found that nearly one third of sexually exploited youth self-identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
Research from the Family Acceptance Project has shown that the average age that an individual “comes out” as GLBT has lowered over time. In the 1970s people were coming out in their early 20s and today the average age that a youth comes out is 13. This younger age means that the youth is most likely still living with their parents or other caregivers who may or may not be accepting of the youth’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Too many GLBT youth still face significant challenges during adolescence and early adulthood, fighting discrimination, misconceptions, and abuse by peers, family members, and others in their communities. The Family Acceptance Project’s research also shows that one out of every four youth that come out may be forced out or kicked out of their home by their parents or caregivers. Additionally, transgender individuals experience greater difficulty in finding employment due to transphobia, which can also contribute to an increased risk of sexual exploitation. In fact, a recent study of transgender youth found that 67 percent had engaged in sex work.
According to the Polaris Project, one of the largest resources for sexually exploited people, of the large population of homeless youth who identify as GLBT, 46 percent ran away because of family rejection, they are 7.4 times more likely to experience acts of sexual violence than heterosexual peers, and are three to seven times more likely to engage in survival sex to meet basic needs such as shelter, food, and toiletries.
Holger-Ambrose has seen a myriad of reasons for youth to engage in sex work. “Sometimes they are becoming involved because they are literally on the streets homeless and they need a place to stay,” she shares. “Someone approaches them and says, ‘I can provide this for you, just come with me to this party, give a couple blow jobs, it’s really easy, and then you don’t have to worry about a safe place to stay anymore.’ Sometimes it’s because literally the youth have no where to stay and someone says they will provide that for them, at a price.”
But needing a place to stay isn’t the only avenue into the life. Holger-Ambrose remembers one 16-year-old who identified as cisgender male and gay. “He was way out in the far out suburbs and felt very isolated, didn’t know a lot of other gay people,” she remembers. “We have heard those stories a lot about isolation. This young person felt very isolated and was on internet chat rooms and online like most young people his age are, and unfortunately he was approached online by a man in his late 60s in Texas who groomed him online.”
That older man created an online relationship with the youth, groomed him (built an emotional connection with the young man to gain his trust for the purposes of sexual abuse or exploitation), and then flew to Minnesota and trafficked the boy back to Texas with him. “Because he groomed him and told him how special he was and how amazing he was, that older man basically got him to sleep with him and got him to sleep with other ‘friends,’ but he profited off of that and earned money off of that.”
GLBT people have historically faced discrimination and oppression. Stigmatization and rejection continue today, putting this population at an increased risk for depression, suicide, substance abuse, homelessness, being victims of bullying and other forms of violence, including sexual exploitation.
Whether it is bullying and isolation, as was the case for the 16-year-old Holger-Ambrose worked with, or personal conflict with family and friends, Commander Thomasser says it almost always stems from sort of trouble in the young person’s life.
“Maybe they’re having trouble at home with a parent, they’re having trouble at school, they’re hanging out with the wrong crowd, but for whatever reason they have needs that aren’t being met and then these people step in and take advantage of these folks,” he says. “Does this occur in the LGBT community? Of course it does, because just like every other community there are vulnerable kids and young adults. So if it’s anything that would cause a person to turn to somebody else in a trusting way, and that person that they turn to has got evil intentions, these things occur.”
The reality is, once someone becomes involved in the life, it is difficult for many individuals to reach out for assistance, but this is especially true for individuals who fear that they will be mistreated or not believed because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. The Polaris Project found that GLBT youth are overrepresented in detention for prostitution-related offenses and report higher levels of police misconduct than their straight peers.
Furthermore, gay and transgender youth may not have access to anti-trafficking services because they are unaware of services in their area, the community lacks resources (e.g. bed space, funding), or they are concerned that providers are not GLBT friendly.
The trouble with exploitation, especially when the victims are young people without easy access to resources or a place to stay, is that it becomes a cycle of dependency making it difficult for the young person to leave the life. Ryan Berg, the program manager for the ConneQt Host Home Program with Avenues for Homeless Youth says usually multiple service providers will be working on the trauma involved with the experience. Which means, depending on the level of trauma, it varies between a short turnaround to needing a great deal of time and a real safe, affirming space for the youth to get back on their feet.
Holger-Ambrose mentioned that the time it takes to get out of exploitation could also relate to how long they’ve been involved in the life. “I worked with youth that first got trafficked when they were as young as 10 or 11, and then I meet them when they’re 16 or 17,” she shares. “So then they’re several years deep into the life. Sometimes I’ve seen youth who are able to — once they connect with supportive services — get out that same week. They don’t want to be in the situation. But I’ve also seen youth that take several years of going back and forth. They might leave the life for a couple months and then something triggers them to go back in, maybe it’s a crisis where they need bail money for somebody, or whatever it is.”
That kind of back and forth can take as long as four or five years, according to Holger-Ambrose. But not everyone makes it to support services or police. Retired New York City detective James Rothstein says, for the most part, there is no getting out. “You end up dead,” he says. “You’ll see a lot of suicides. But many of them are killed, they disappear, nobody knows who they are.”
“What happens is this: they are used until they have no value anymore,” Rothstein continues. “Then usually they get to the point where they help recruit other kids. And then by the time they get into their mid-20s, many of them then themselves become perpetrators.”
One respondent to Holger-Ambrose’s survey gives a perfect example of the dangerous nature of trading sex for survival. “I had a pimp and would have to get high to turn tricks,” she shares. “It’s painful, disgusting, and makes me depressed. I’ve been raped, stabbed, jumped out of a moving vehicle while it was still moving, robbed, been shot at, left for dead once, and have had my head busted two times.”
For a crime that impacts every community so prevalently, anyone involved with the prosecution of perpetrators or treatment of victims agrees that sexual exploitation is not talked about enough. It is a heavy topic to discuss. Sexual exploitation and trafficking takes place in the shadows of the Twin Cities, according to Mandy Multerer, co-founder of My Sister, an apparel company whose mission is to raise awareness on the topic.
“People don’t want to know or think that it’s even happening in their area,” Multerer says. “Especially Minneapolis, you may live in an area where it’s happening all the time and you just don’t know about it.”
She says all it takes is a drive down Lake Street to witness sexual exploitation in action. “You can see the patterns of walking and then their pimps and traffickers might be around the corner and you could see them in their cars,” Multerer said. “The FBI actually identified Minneapolis as one of the top 13 cities for child sex trafficking, so that’s really important for us to talk about, but it’s really a problem in every city and every state.”
According to Multerer, one of the biggest misconceptions about Minnesota being so high on the FBI’s list is the idea of Duluth as a hub for trafficking. “That’s not necessarily a port where people are getting imported and exported,” she says. “More so it’s a port for people serving the boat workers type of thing.”
And Holger-Ambrose doesn’t get behind the stereotype of youth getting recruited at the Mall of America. Instead, she says, “More youth get recruited by peers, family members, or online way more often than someone being approached at the Mall of America.”
As someone who works specifically with GLBT youth, Berg notices that the places that youth go for comfort can actually be dangerous. “Bars and clubs are kind of sacred spaces for queer and trans folk, but also those spaces can be hunting grounds for those that want to exploit others,” he says. “Even though these spaces can become havens for young people who are grappling with identity and looking for community, it’s also a space to be hyperalert and vigilant of your surroundings. It becomes a space where young people can become vulnerable to exploitation.”
Some of the largest misperceptions, however, involve the identities of the victims and perpetrators. According to Commander Thomasser, most people would believe sexual exploitation is a problem for young girls, and he is quick to dispute that. Although more female-identified youth come forward, male-identified youth make up a large portion of victims as well, with research showing that youth that identify as boys or girls are exploited at equal rates. “It’s as much a problem for young men as it is young girls,” he says. “And so if they think this is a suburban male predator going after young girls, it’s far broader than that.”
And even then, it’s commonly believed that male victims identify as gay, which isn’t always the case. “Some boys in the life will actually use the term gay for pay,” Holger-Ambrose says. “Just because someone is involved with sexual exploitation and they’re having sex with somebody in exchange for money or anything else, it doesn’t necessarily define what their sexual orientation is. Boys that are involved with the sex trade or sexual exploitation often get typecast as all being gay, which isn’t always true.”
Similar stereotypes exist surrounding the perpetrators, with most people thinking that it is male traffickers. Commander Thomasser divides perpetrators into two categories: those responsible for recruiting the victim into the lifestyle (the trafficker) and those who are buying sex, or engaging in the commercial sex aspect (the John).
Johns tend to be middle-aged males of all races, according to Commander Thomasser, who says he doesn’t arrest a lot of women for seeking commercial sex for money. Although, he admits, there are probably women who engage in that as well and just aren’t caught. But when it comes to traffickers, he says they can look like anything and be anyone. “The idea that we are now prosecuting women for exactly the same behavior as men shows that that sort of stereotype is getting broken down,” he says.
Service providers notice similar trends as the St. Paul Police Department. At The Link, Holger-Ambrose says regardless of the youth being exploited, the buyer is almost always a male. The trafficker, however, runs the gamut of gender, race, and other identities. She says, “There’s a lot of stereotypes that only males are traffickers or pimps but we actually see female pimps whether it’s a relative, like an older sister or older friend or mothers — people hate to think that, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s a relative, sometimes it’s a friend, but there definitely are female traffickers, female pimps, as well as males.”
Since identities of traffickers are somewhat fluid, the key to assisting victims is knowing the warning signs, which can be difficult. Rothstein has a saying: “There are as many things to look for as there are grains of sand on a beach.” But he says you will always notice a change in lifestyle for the young person. “You can spot it, you watch a change.”
According to Commander Thomasser, the warning signs are evident, but parents and friends need to pay attention to the young people. “Sometimes they’ll notice that their kids are maybe hanging out with people who are older than them,” he says. “Is that in itself a warning sign? No, but it could be one thing that goes with some others.”
Other things to watch out for include if the young person is coming home with nice gifts — nice clothes, a new phone — things that are beyond their normal reach, that might be a clue that someone is giving them these things to entice them into what they’re looking for long term. He says, “Looking for signs when they come home that something is going on where they may be interacting with others while they’re away and living beyond their means or really don’t need the household any longer because someone else is taking care of them. Those might be some signs to pay attention to.”
Unexplainable absences are also a red flag, according to Holger-Ambrose, especially if the youth normally shows up for school or a job consistently and then they are suddenly missing for chunks of time. “If they’re kind of missing and they don’t have a good explanation of where they’re going, that’s a big one,” she says. “They kind of go AWOL, like three or four days they’re missing here and there, that would be a red flag because that could be a sign that their trafficker is taking them around to different states or different locations on a party circuit or something like that.”
“If they have a tattoo that they don’t feel comfortable explaining to you, sometimes traffickers will get their name or a barcode or something like that, not always but sometimes,” she continues. “Also, if a young person is talking about making a lot of money or going to fancy parties or something like that, but then don’t seem able to actually keep the money, that might also be a red flag.”
After looking at the warning signs, Thomasser and Holger-Ambrose agree that the best thing to do is reach out for help, even if you aren’t completely sure someone is being exploited. The St. Paul Police Department is always looking for the public’s help in finding crimes where and when they are occurring.
“If someone thinks or suspects, they don’t even have to know for sure, if you just think this person might be being sexually exploited,” Holger-Ambrose says, “you can refer that person to a regional navigator (a regional first point of contact in Minnesota for someone being exploited), or you, yourself, as a concerned citizen, could call our regional navigator and just talk through the situation and get some advice and resources. If anyone is directly connected with a youth they think is being trafficked, the best thing to do would be to connect them with the regional navigator in the area.”
It can be difficult for victims of trafficking to disclose their situation and reach out for help. Many victims do not identify as victims of trafficking, fear the repercussions of reporting their situation, or simply do not know that help is available. For the safety and well-being of the victim, Minnesota passed the Safe Harbor Law in 2011, decriminalizing prostitution for youth under 18. Holger-Ambrose, who helped create the law, says prior to the law’s passing, youth were getting picked up and arrested for prostitution and then put in juvenile detention.
“Basically treating them like a criminal even though someone else was trafficking them and profiting off their exploitation, and then they were getting released right back to their trafficker,” she says. “Before Safe Harbor, they were all going to juvenile detention, which I can only imagine how horrible that is after you’ve been raped multiple times in hotel rooms for someone else to make money and then to be arrested and placed in juvenile detention — it’s just the most horrific response. So what’s really nice is that, now, the response is to provide them with supportive services and to have the youth have a choice in that and if they do need a safe space to stay, refer them to a therapeutic and supportive service type of shelter or housing program versus juvenile detention.”
Some service providers, however, offer housing and assistance for youth up to the age of 24, which is crucial according to Multerer. “When we talk about youth it definitely is up to that age because a lot of the youth that have been exploited started when they were really young,” she says. “So then they don’t have that education and foundation at 18 to just cut them off and send them away.”
The message Holger-Ambrose wants to send is that young people who have been victimized by sexual exploitation or involved with the life are incredibly resilient and are able to successfully transition out of it when they have the right kind of support in their life.
“People who have been victims of sexual exploitation are amazing, resilient people that have a lot of dreams and goals for themselves just like everybody else,” She says. “The experience of sexual exploitation shouldn’t define them or put a label over them. It’s only one experience they’ve had in their life. We just have to, as a society, see them in a more positive way and give them opportunities to follow those other dreams they have for themselves.
That’s a sentiment echoed by Berg, who says that education is an important role in combating exploitation. Berg encourages everyone to do some research and be aware of the services that are available for young people lured into the life.
“Sometimes as a society we’ve been guilty of victim blaming,” he says. “So we need to recognize the fact that these young people have been targeted, have been exploited, and need support. If it is a young person that has resorted to, for example, prostitution, that we realize they are victims of circumstance and of systems and folks that are exploiting them.”
“They’re victims and survivors and not criminals,” he continues. “When we label young people who experience exploitation as criminals, we dehumanize them and separate them; it’s easier to just let things go on, business as usual. But they need to be treated with dignity and respect and provided with the services they need. It’s really about recognizing that they’re human beings with lots of complexity, and they shouldn’t be criminalized.”

Transgender activist Ruby Corado is fighting for Washington D.C.’s most vulnerable. Known as "Mama Ruby" among the city’s LGBTQ youth, the advocate is the proud founder of Casa Ruby, a homeless shelter and advocacy organization for the LGBTQ community.
“I’m known as the person in the city who will work with those people nobody wants to touch,” Corado told NBC Out.

A transgender woman who grew up in El Salvador, Corado overcame many hardships before opening her center. In the 1980s, her father paid human traffickers to get her out of the war-torn country. She said a bus took her to Washington D.C, where traffickers gave the then 16-year-old a room and took all the money she earned working odd jobs.
“The guy of the house — the [head] of the house — tried to rape me, and I run away,” said Corado, who speaks with an accent.
Corado, who was living as a gay man at the time, slept in parks and sometimes stayed with friends until she earned enough to get her own room. In 1989, a real estate rental office hired her as a cleaner and later offered to train her to be a manager.
“I felt like I had won the lottery,” she recalled.
But Corado’s prospects dimmed in the mid-1990s when she started coming out as transgender. She took up drag pageantry while frequenting the clubs in Dupont Circle, a neighborhood known for its gay nightlife.
“I was crowned Miss Gay El Salvador, and every afternoon I would put my crown on and walk around because I felt beautiful,” she said. But the more she donned her wig and pumps outside the clubs, the more she realized she was “a little bit more gay than most people.” Corado said she started to medically transition to female on her own with hormones she bought on the streets.
“Once I transitioned, life was horrible, because even in the gay neighborhood they would accept gay people, but they wouldn’t accept trans,” she explained. Stores refused to serve her. Bus drivers pulled over and told her to get off. A cashier in a fast food restaurant threw change at her. People at work “would say things,” she said. Feeling unwelcome, Corado left her job and turned to sex work to survive.
“I totally, totally hated it, but you know, I had no choice,” she said. Despite her setbacks, Corado was determined to make a difference. She volunteered at local LGBTQ and HIV clinics where she realized she had a knack for helping others. One of the clinics hired her. She said the experience opened her eyes to the lack of safe spaces for LGBTQ youth and inspired a vision.
“I had a dream I was running a gay [homeless] shelter, and in this dream I was putting these satin sheets on the beds, and it was so pretty, and it was very gay,” Corado recalled.

In 2003, Corado co-founded the DC Trans Coalition, an advocacy organization that became a leading force for transgender rights in Washington D.C. But her dreams were nearly shattered after a boyfriend brutally attacked and nearly killed her in 2009, she said. Traumatized, she was unable to work or pay her rent. She moved into a homeless shelter and was granted a $12,000 disability check after a year of struggling. She decided to use the money to open the shelter she dreamed of.
“I’m like, ‘This is it, I’m going to start the organization. I’m going to open a center.' And a big part of it was healing myself from a lot of pain,” Corado said.

In 2012, Corado opened Casa Ruby. Originally a single-floor, drop-in center, it has expanded to multiple houses that provide services and emergency housing for Washington D.C.’s LGBTQ population.
“I sat there before I opened it, and I was like, ‘Dreams do come true,’” Corado said, her voice breaking.
The 40-bed shelter has housed more than 500 people over the past several years. And while Casa Ruby accepts people of all ages across the LGBTQ spectrum, a large portion of those it serves are transgender and gender-nonconforming youth of color, according to Corado.
“Some housing programs will kick them out if they don’t come home at 10 o’clock, but I don’t do that,” she said. “I work with them. I understand them, because they have trauma. I have trauma.”
The 47-year-old said running an LGBTQ center has its challenges. In March, a man threw a brick through a window and attacked one of the center's transgender staff members — the third time in two weeks the center had been vandalized. Following the attacks, Casa Ruby received overwhelming love and support, including cards and donations from people across the country, Corado said. A local gay bar raised $17,000, and an online fundraiser has garnered nearly $15,000 for the center.
“It just filled my heart,” Corado said.
According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, 20 to 40 percent of homeless youth in the United States identify as LGBTQ. Corado said 110 youth are currently on Casa Ruby’s waitlist.
To Corado, it means there is a lot more work to do. “I’m not done,” she promised. “I have a big community behind me.”

Portraits of 22 different women lined the walls of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in June. The temporary photography installation featured a diverse group of women, holding onto a symbol of who they are and who they aspire to be. One grasped a molecular model to represent her career in science, while another was draped in a cap and gown, illustrating the completion of her education.
Beside each portrait was a plaque that shared a story of that individual’s life. All featured a central theme: They were all survivors of sexual exploitation.
The exhibit is part of the traveling “More Than a Survivor” campaign, which is meant to depict survivors of sexual assault as more than just victims, but as scholars, scientist, photographers and more. But this isn’t the first attempt by Hartsfield-Jackson to bring awareness to human trafficking through art. In 2015, the airport revealed the exhibit “Freedom Expression ATL,” which was meant to raise awareness about the issue.
Human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal issue in the world, and there is a misconception that it only occurs on foreign land. But the sad truth is, it’s right under our noses. Atlanta is one of the 14 U.S. cities, named by the FBI, with the highest rate of children used in sex trafficking, with the airport being a popular pickup spot for those who fall victim.
Homeless youths are particularly vulnerable to becoming victims of both sex and labor trafficking, and while they have often been seen as an invisible population, leaving them undercounted for years, they are anything but absent.
Between 2014 and 2016, researchers interviewed homeless youths from 10 Covenant House sites, a shelter for unoccupied youths, in the U.S. and Canada. The study showed that 19 percent of the 641 young people interviewed had been victims of trafficking — 14 percent were coerced into sex trafficking, while 8 percent had been trafficked for forced labor and 3 percent had been trafficked in both.
“Some became involved because they had no place to live, they had no means to support themselves, no way to feed themselves and these were people who offered to provide those things that they couldn’t have had otherwise, and they really felt they had no choice. And some of them, when they realized the situation they were in, they were afraid to leave. They were threatened with their life and with their safety, and some of them couldn’t leave,” said Debra Schilling Wolfe, executive director of the Field Center for Children’s Policy, Practice & Research.
The majority of youth who had experienced some form of trafficking were vulnerable because of economic factors and found themselves desperate for work, making them susceptible to being taken advantage of. Others reported they feared sleeping on the streets, leaving them vulnerable to being trafficked in both sex and labor work. Nineteen percent of all the youths interviewed had engaged in “survival sex” — sex for food, housing or other basic necessities.
“Homeless young people stand out to the community, predators can identify who they are. They see their vulnerability and they approach them and try to take advantage of them,” Wolfe said. “And what stunned us were the sheer number that had been approached for sex on the very first night they were homeless. So, we know, as a population they are identified and targeted.”
While all homeless youths are vulnerable to trafficking, one group that stood as being disproportionately affected by trafficking was homeless LGBTQ youths. While only 19 percent of the respondents that were interviewed identified as LGBTQ, they accounted for 36 percent of sex trafficking victims.
Laura Murphy, the director of Loyola University’s Modern Slavery Research Project, believes this is because of the disproportionate number of homeless LGBTQ youths. (According to The Williams Institute, 40 percent of homeless youths identify as LGBTQ.) She also attributes it to the amount of workplace discrimination, which makes it difficult for them to have sustainable work and formal employment opportunities.
“I think that young people who are LGBT are particularly vulnerable around the ages of 16 and 18,” Murphy said. “It’s the average age of young people [entering the sex trade].
“It’s really important that we look at how it’s economic factors and the lack of a social support network that make young people vulnerable to exploitation,” she said. “What really lacks attention are the things that young people actually need, like housing and jobs and a reasonable rate of pay, and sustainable living situations and support networks. That’s where we need to pay attention.”
For Murphy, these important aspects are what makes organizations like Covenant House even more important. The shelter houses homeless youths in 30 cities across six countries — the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Covenant House Georgia, located in Atlanta, works with 45 homeless youths between the ages 18 and 21 daily at its crisis shelter. All of them are allowed to stay until the age of 24.
The organization has a number of resources in place to reach out to youths who have been victims of trafficking and to help prevent it from occurring to those at risk. They offer outreach programs that provide information and resources on trafficking as well as food and other supplies. They also provide mental health services, both individual and group therapy focused on sexual exploitation and trauma.
“Many of our youths are unaware that they have been sexually exploited until they come to therapy and learn and process the definition of sex trafficking and begin to understand that their boyfriend or someone close to them was their exploiter or trafficker,” said Dr. Jessica Henry, clinical director of Covenant House Georgia.

As for prevention, Wolfe believes the passing of Safe Harbor laws, which decriminalize prostitution and related charges for victims of sex trafficking, would be helpful. She also hopes to see an expansion of outreach services and support systems for young people who fall victim to homelessness.
Murphy’s focus is on the importance of funding. She believes it is important to put more resources into training law enforcement and social service providers. Funding for sustainable housing and job skill training programs, are also important investments to make for prevention, Murphy said.
“The thing we need to do is address the root problems, which are poverty and homelessness and poor education and lack of jobs. That’s really where it’s at,” Murphy said. “So long as legislators don’t want to fund that, they will continue to be responsible for trafficking. Funding is crucial.”
Individuals interested in helping homeless youths can get involved through volunteering, donating or visiting the Covenant House website.
WACO - More than 300,000 victims of human trafficking are living in Texas at this very moment, according to a 2016 studyby the University of Texas at Austin. Of those victims, nearly 80,000 are minors who were sex trafficked.
Central Texas has become a sex trafficking corridor for two main reasons: its position along Interstate 35 and its relatively close proximity to the Mexican border, according to the Central Texas Coalition Against Human Trafficking.
Both the victims and criminals engaged in sex trafficking defy many assumptions about the human trafficking crisis. For example, female traffickers likely outnumber male traffickers worldwide, according to a report from the United Nations.
Waco-based Unbound works to prevent human trafficking in Central Texas. According to data on its website, men are often trafficking victims and runaway/homeless youth are most vulnerable to sex trafficking -- with LGBT youth making up more than 40-percent of homeless youth in the United States.
The Heart of Texas Human Trafficking Coalition, a multi-agency effort led by Unbound, hosted a roundtable discussion Thursday. During the conversation, experts said they had seen an increase in local youth kicked out of their homes --  many of them gay and transgender. It only takes about 48 hours of them being on the streets to be recruited by traffickers, according to officials.
"When there is an adult who has a close relationship with a child who isn't a family member and is providing them with money and gifts,we have to look into that more, especially when its someone who shouldn't have that relationship with a child," Waco Police Detective Kim Clark said.
Since January, the Heart of Texas Human Trafficking Coalition has helped 39 sex trafficking victims. While most of those victims were female, the group said all the agencies involved want to make sure nobody falls through the cracks. Stakeholders who attended the meeting worked together in groups to better identify victims and what resources needed to be available in Central Texas to help prevent trafficking.
There were 499 reported cases of human trafficking in San Francisco last year, according to a report by the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking released Friday.
“Human trafficking is happening here in San Francisco,” said Minouche Kandel, the director of women’s policy at the San Francisco Department on the Status of Women. “A lot of people think of human trafficking as a problem that happens in other countries and developing countries, but it’s happening right here in our backyard.”
The report collected data from 15 government and community-based agencies that provide services to victims of human trafficking. In order to maintain the privacy of the survivors, no names were included, which means the data likely contain duplicates where the same victim was recorded by multiple agencies.
“Human trafficking is really hidden,” Kandel said. “So by doing this report, we’re starting to shine a light. We still have a lot more work to do, but it’s a good first step.”
According to the report, 237 of the cases involved a victim under 25-years old, and 122 had victims 18-years old or younger. The vast majority of those were involved in commercial sexual exploitation.
“We’ve been seeing this need for a long time, and it’s nice to see it backed up by data,” said Carly Devlin, the intervention services coordinator for Huckleberry Youth Programs.
Devlin said the experience of youth who have been trafficked for sex varies for each individual and situation.
“We need to be really attentive to youth needs and what do individualized services look like for young people,” she said.
Kandel said most of these children are U.S. residents and not from other countries, and are often a part of the foster and/or juvenile justice systems. According to Kandel, the vast majority of the young people identified in the report as having been trafficked for sex were African-Americans.
The report also sheds light on some of the strides that have been made in the past year in the area of youth sex trafficking, including decriminalizing prostitution for minors, a 24-hour crisis hotline and services for sexually exploited youth, and an increase in focus and training on human trafficking by the San Francisco Unified School District.
Devlin said that finding a way to house youth who have been trafficked is crucial to helping them move on. She said there are very few housing options in the child welfare system for youth in the city where many want to be, and that also take into account the specific needs of this population.
“What would it take to have responsive housing that meets youth where they’re at?” she said.
Other accomplishments highlighted by the report include stronger licensing and enforcement of massage establishments in San Francisco, funding for bilingual outreach to workers in vulnerable industries and support for the No Traffick Ahead Campaign to encourage hotels and restaurants to address human trafficking.
Women, including transgender women, accounted for 80 percent of the cases where the victim’s gender was known.
“We know that women and girls are over-represented in trafficking victims,” Kandel said, as are LGBT youth. “It was very important for us to try to the extent that we could collect information on gender and including transgender youth.”
Kandel admits that the are many imperfections with the data in this report and all data concerning human trafficking, but that it can help establish a baseline to better understand the issue in the Bay Area.
“There are very few other cities that are doing this kind of data collection,” she said.
She said improving data collection by removing duplicates will be an important next step as well as using this data to increase services for survivors.
